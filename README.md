# VSDSquadron Mini-intership
1-month Research Internship on VSD Squadron Mini based on RISC-V.

The board is powered by CH32V003F4U6 chip with a 32-bit RISC-V core based on the RV32EC instruction set, designed for high-performance computing with a 24MHz system clock. It features factory-calibrated 24MHz and 128kHz RC oscillators, along with support for an external 24MHz oscillator to accommodate diverse clocking needs. The board offers 15 GPIO pins arranged into 3 groups, enabling versatile peripheral integration and external interrupt functionality. It supports communication via UART, I2C, and SPI protocols and includes 2KB of SRAM, 16KB of CodeFlash, and 1920B allocated for bootloader storage. Additionally, the integrated CH32V305FBP6 programmer simplifies development by allowing direct code uploading and debugging without requiring extra adapters.
